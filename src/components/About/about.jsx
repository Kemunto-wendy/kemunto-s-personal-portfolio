                    <p>Web developers are experts at bringing a vision to life.
                    They take ideas and transform them into fully functional websites
                     using various development tools and programming languages.
                The development process is generally split between front-end and back-end tasks.
                Front-end developers focus on user interfaces, graphics, fonts, images, styles, layouts,
                content structure, and anything else a user can view or interact with. Back-end developers
                are more concerned with functionality. They focus on data handling, storage, and optimization within database systems.
                  If youâ€™ve picked up some coding skills and decided to focus on front-end development,
                   then the next step is to land a job you love. A strong portfolio and resume will help you
                    stand out from a pool of applicants, but you need a solid cover letter to seal the deal.
                    Here are our best tips for nailing the letter and getting hired as a front-end developer.</p>
